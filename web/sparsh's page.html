 I'm obsessed with clouds because they're absolutely gorgeous, magical and also it's calming to stare at them as they move across the sky!.
 And what I mean by calming, is that staring deeop into clouds gets us out of our thinking minds ans into that sweet still place inside where we can enjoy the experience of being alive,
 not doing something.
